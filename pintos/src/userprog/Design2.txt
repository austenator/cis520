A file descriptor is an integer associated with a given file and process. When a file is opened by a process, it
is assigned a file descriptor and added to the list of open files for that particular process. The file
descriptor is unique to a single process, not any other processes in the operating systems.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
